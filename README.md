- To create a new mineSweeper game you only have to generate a new instance from the library with two parameters, the first one is a literal object which has a grid property with a number of rows and columns (grid:[rows,columns]) and an other property number of mines('minas' in spanish).

- Next you should launch creaJuego() method with an optional parameter, this one is the id of the tag where you wish to put the game, notice that if you don't give this argument, the game will be append at the body tag.

- To give a style to your games, I created the library with a css that you can modify changing the propertys of the clases.

*[notice that you can not modify the size of the mines without changing some values of the js library by now ... i'm working on it]

- I'm working on create more methods like get the number of remaining mines, restart the game, include a timer, etc.

This is only an exercise i made for myself in a first instance, without any intention of create something usefully in a real project, but i would to share it. I know i'm not the first one who has created this kind of library, but as i said, it's only a practice for myself.

and sorry for my english.... :D
